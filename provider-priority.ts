/**
 * Where work goes once the account it was on cannot take it.
 *
 * ## What was actually happening
 *
 * Rotation already gets the first step right: of 602 automatic failovers in this machine's black
 * box, 588 stayed inside the same provider family — the same subscription, the same model, just
 * another account. That is the behaviour to protect, and nothing here weakens it.
 *
 * The other 14 are the problem. Those are the hops taken once every account of the current family
 * was spent, and they went nowhere in particular:
 *
 *     kimi-coding → openai-codex   3      cursor       → openai-codex  1
 *     openai-codex → anthropic     3      anthropic    → cursor        1
 *     kimi-coding → anthropic      2      ollama       → kimi-coding   2
 *     kimi-coding → cursor         2
 *
 * There was no ladder being followed, because nothing expressed one. The comparator ordered
 * cross-family candidates by liveness telemetry — measured-free first, then predicted-free, then
 * whoever refused longest ago — and only fell through to the configured family order as a last
 * tiebreak, by which point it almost never spoke. So the answer to "the whole family is spent,
 * where now?" was whatever the telemetry happened to say that second.
 *
 * The second half of the same gap: `providerOrder` could only ever name the six specially-managed
 * families. Accounts outside them — openrouter, zai, minimax, opencode-go-api, openai — could not
 * be placed in the order at all, so they sat permanently last by construction. In 602 automatic
 * failovers not one ever reached them. That is right as a default (they bill per token, while the
 * managed families are flat-rate subscriptions), but it should be a stated policy the user can
 * change, not an accident of the type system.
 *
 * ## The ladder
 *
 * A flat, ordered list of provider GROUPS. A group is a managed family (`anthropic`,
 * `openai-codex`, `kimi-coding`, `cursor`, `qwen`, `ollama`) or the base id of anything else the
 * user is logged in to (`openrouter`, `zai`, `minimax`, …) — numbered rotation slots of the same
 * account (`openai-codex-account-3`) all collapse to one group, because preferring one slot over
 * its sibling is rotation's job, not the ladder's.
 *
 * Three rules, and they are deliberately narrow:
 *
 * 1. **The ladder never overrides same-family.** Staying on the family preserves the model the
 *    user picked, and it is the step that already works. The ladder only decides what happens
 *    after that step has run out.
 * 2. **The ladder never overrides availability.** An account on a real cooldown is not chosen
 *    while a free one exists, whatever the ladder says. The ladder reorders candidates that are
 *    all selectable right now; it does not resurrect spent ones.
 * 3. **A group nobody ranked sorts after every group somebody did**, keeping its existing order
 *    among its unranked peers. Silence is not a preference, so it must not act like one.
 *
 * Within those bounds the ladder outranks the liveness heuristics (`confirmed`, `predictedBusy`),
 * and that is the point. Those heuristics answer "did the provider recently tell us it is free?",
 * whose honest answer for an unmeasurable provider is always "no" — absence of measurement, not
 * evidence of exhaustion. A stated preference is better evidence than a missing measurement. The
 * cost when the ladder is wrong is bounded and self-correcting: one request, one refusal, a
 * cooldown, and the account drops out of the candidate list on its own.
